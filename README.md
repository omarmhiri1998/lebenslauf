This project is designed to showcase a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS, with a focus on creating a user-friendly, visually appealing navigation system. The goal is to provide users with a seamless browsing experience, allowing them to easily explore different sections of the portfolio such as "About", "Projects", and "Contact". The navigation system uses anchor links to allow users to jump to specific parts of the page with a smooth scrolling effect.

For your portfolio project, here are the essential tools and technologies you would need to design and deploy a well-structured, responsive, and visually engaging website:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
Purpose: HTML serves as the backbone of the website, providing the structure for various sections and elements like headings, text, images, and links.
Usage in Project: HTML is used to create the different sections of the portfolio, such as the "About Me", "Projects", and "Contact" sections. It will also define the navigation links, allowing users to quickly jump to the relevant parts of the page.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
Purpose: CSS is used for styling and enhancing the visual presentation of the webpage. It provides layout, design, and interactivity features like hover effects and transitions.
Usage in Project: CSS will style the layout of the portfolio, ensuring that it is aesthetically pleasing and responsive. This includes styling the navigation bar, ensuring smooth transitions between sections, and enhancing the overall appearance of the page with colors, fonts, and spacing. Additionally, CSS will be used to implement the smooth scrolling effect when users click on navigation links, improving user experience.
